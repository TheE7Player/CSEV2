# CSEV2
Counter Strike Event Viewer 2

Rewrite of the orginal CSEV made in Java

This is made using Python and parses a `.yaml` file instead of a new type of `.json` that was used in the first edition.

This uses `Flaskwebgui` as its front-end, and - as you know - `Python` as its backend.

This application uses little `Jquery` and `JS` to allow functionality to flow
